Hi, I'm Miguel.

My job consists in helping companies to analyze and visualize datasets. I am skilled in data pre-processing, analysis, data visualization, and results communication with stakeholders.

Over the past few years, I've developed an extensive skill set to prepare for a future career in the tech industry. In particular, I've about 3 years of professional experience in the quality department (as a Quality Assurance Analyst and Quality Lead in the BPO industry), which gave me the ability to translate complex questions into understandable insights and data-driven decisions.
